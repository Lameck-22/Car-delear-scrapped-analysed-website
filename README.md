##  Problem Statement
The Kenyan car market is characterized by fluctuating prices and a wide variety of options, making it challenging for buyers and sellers to understand current trends. There is a lack of accessible, comprehensive data that highlights pricing dynamics and vehicle availability. This project seeks to address this gap by scraping car data from a car listings website, enabling a deeper understanding of pricing trends and market behavior through a user-friendly dashboard that facilitates exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Findings
- The latest vehicle models tend to command higher price premiums when compared to older versions, reflecting advancements in technology, safety features, and design.
- Comparative analysis indicates that modern vehicles generally feature larger engine displacements compared to their older counterparts.
- A clear inverse relationship exist between engine size and vehicle cost, with more affordable vehicles typically having smaller engine displacements
- All the vehicles manufactured in 2024 are foreign used and are more than KES 10M. This is a clear indication that there is a positive correlation between the age and price of the vehicle
- Imported vehicles typically command higher prices than locally used kenyan vehicles.

## Conclusion
This project successfully scraped and analyzed car data from a car listings website, providing insights into the Kenyan car market. Key findings revealed correlations between vehicle age and price, as well as engine size and affordability. The interactive dashboard offers users a valuable tool for exploring these trends, addressing the need for accessible market data.
